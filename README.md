## Generating summary graphs

* [S2L](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10618-016-0468-8) custom implementation (used for directed and/or edge-weighted graphs, as well as smaller graphs): [`Dump-summary-S2L.ipynb`](nb/Dump-summary-S2L.ipynb) notebook

* [S2L](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10618-016-0468-8) official implementation (used for larger graphs):
